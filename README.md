# PasswordLogger

This is my first cydia tweak, that will log passwords into a file.

# Log File Location
Originally the passwords would be logged into Log.txt in Users/Documents/PasswordLogger
Just for testing purposes because I am running into problems, it just saves it somewhere as Log.txt
I am just using iFile/Filza to find it, but it hasn't been created

#The project was named 'firsttweak' on my computer.
